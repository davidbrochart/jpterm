## Key bindings

The notebook editor has two modes: command mode and edit mode. You can enter edit mode by clicking on a cell input, or by hiting `Enter`. In this mode you edit the content of a cell. That's how you can type code or text into a cell. Hiting `Esc` in this mode enters the command mode, which allows to manipulate cells, for instance delete, copy, paste, move or insert a new cell.

### Edit mode

- `Esc`: exit edit mode and enter command mode.
- `Ctrl-E`: execute cell (and stay on that cell).
- `Ctrl-R`: execute cell (and move to next cell).

### Command mode

- `Enter`: exit command mode and enter edit mode.
- `Up`: move to cell above.
- `Down`: move to cell below.
- `Ctrl-Up`: move cell up.
- `Ctrl-Down`: move cell down.
- `Ctrl-S`: save notebook to disk (no effect in collaborative mode).
- `A`: insert new empty cell above.
- `B`: insert new empty cell below.
- `L`: clear current cell's outputs.
- `C`: copy current cell.
- `X`: cut current cell.
- `Ctrl-V`: paste cell above.
